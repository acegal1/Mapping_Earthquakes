# Mapping_Earthquakes

# Overview of Project

 The project is to view the earthquake data in relation to the tectonic platesâ€™ location on the earth, and to display all the earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.5 on the map. 

The Dark view is the data on a third map.
 
 Using  knowledge of JavaScript, Leaflet.js, and geoJSON data, I added tectonic plate data using d3.json(), then added the data using the geoJSON() layer, set the tectonic plate LineString data to stand out on the map, and add the tectonic plate data to the overlay object with the earthquake data.
# Resources
 Softwares: Leaflet.js library, Javascript, and HTML to retrieve earthquake information from a GeoJSON file and plot the results in a visual format.
